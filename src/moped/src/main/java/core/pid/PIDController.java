 * Created by Emil Jansson on 2017-09-16.

 * This class should be used as a controller for a feedback loop. It contains three constants and a target value which can be modified.
 * The the controller aims to reach a stable state where the current actual value is as close as possible to the target value.
 * Modifying the constants calibrates the controller and changes it's "strategy" to reach equilibrium.

     * This is the PIDController constructor. It creates a new PIDController with custom constants which affect the controllers behavior.

     * @param constantP The proportional constant. A bigger constant means greater reaction effect.
     * @param constantIRelation The relation between the proportional and integral constant where: constantP * constantIRelation = constantI.
     *                          A higher value gives the integral part of the controller more weight which creates a more rapid climb to the target value but might cause overshoot.
     * @param constantDRelation The relation between the proportional and derivative constant where: constantP * constantDRelation = constantD.
     *                          A higher value gives the derivative part of the controller more weight which creates cushioning effect when the error is minimised to fast to mitigate overshoot.
