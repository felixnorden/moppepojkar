The project can be considered done when the group and the product owner agrees that the current version of our product sufficiently matches the project's vision defined below.

### Vision

As a research project for RISE Victoria: A small radio controlled car, featuring programmable control units, called a MOPED are used to study behavior of autonomous cars. These 10 MOPEDs will be able to follow each other in a platooning formation with the MOPED in the front being maneuvered manually. The MOPED will be able to act both independently and as a part of a platoon of autonomously interacting MOPEDs.  The scope of the project is a 5 week period that will culminate in a demo that will be showcased in an indoors campus environment.
