# Team Social Contract

## Whole group culture

- Be on time for meetings
    - Always inform the group at least 10 min beforehand if you are running late
- Respect each other
    - We have zero tolerance for bullying
    - Listen to each other and don't interrupt each other
- Ask for help
- We will give continuous, **constructive** feedback on each members' performance
    - If a member won't adapt to the feedback given, further actions will be taken
    - In the most extreme case, the member may be removed from the group
- Each member will attend course lectures to their own ability
    - If they are going to miss a lecture, they will need to inform the others beforehand
    - If a member misses a lecture, the others will summarize the lecture and the member can read more in-depth on the repository

## Group workflow

- Pair programming will kept be in focus during the work process
