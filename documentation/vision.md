As a research project for RISE Victoria: Small, radio controlled cars, featuring programmable electronic control units, called *"Mobile Open Platform for Experimental Design of Cyber-Physical Systems"*, or "MOPED" are used to study and develop the behavior of autonomous vehicles. The end goal is to deliver software that will act as a core building block in VICTA Lab's research and development of autonomous vehicles for real-world traffic, with the intent of reducing transportation cost, improving traffic safety and mitigating climate influence.

Between the starting point and end goal, a scope of 5 weeks have been set for developing the independent software for each MOPED. After these 5 weeks, a demonstration will be held in an indoor campus environment. This demonstration will showcase 10 unique MOPEDs, each having their own independent software, that follow each other autonomously in a platooning formation with the MOPED in the lead being maneuvered manually. Each MOPED will be able to act both independently and as a part of a platoon of autonomously interacting MOPEDs.
