# LEGO Exercise Learnings

## 1. Communicate during pressure
The first thing that comes to mind is that we as a group must practice at handling stress more efficiently. At the start of the exercise the group was well organized and kept to the scrum methodology. As the work proceeded and the lack of time and resources became clear, the process was only half-heartedly being followed and communication broke down leaving group members partially isolated from each other. This is something we must work on avoiding during the main project as poor communication will put a dent in both the efficiency and the general quality of life in the group.

## 2. Making scrum real
Another thing I learned from the exercise is how the general workflow of scrum actually works in practice. We had heard of the scrum model at earlier lectures but this made things much more concrete and gave the group reference points to point at when discussing scrum. One thing that became very apparent was the importance of the scrum-board and its ability to give an overview of what needs to be done and whatâ€™s currently being worked on.

## 3. Estimation is hard
The final lesson learned that I will mention in this text is the fact that estimating how much work a user story is going to take is very hard. With the limited time we had to estimate our workload, the group came to conclusions that proved to be faulty as we began building the LEGO models. This was mainly due to unforeseen circumstances that became huge time sinks. The most obvious example was the lack of total LEGO pieces to work with which resulted in a substantial scavenging effort for more pieces. We will have to take a lot more time during the MOPED project to evaluate the difficulty of the tasks at hand.
