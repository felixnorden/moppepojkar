# LEGO Exercise Learnings

## First lesson learned

I quickly realized how important a correct estimation of how many "points" a task yields as well as the groups total velocity for the sprint. When the estimations were off, the workload became to much instantly.
We then failed to deliver the potentially shippable product increment.

## Second lesson learned

I also realized that it's very important to split the currently assigned workload into smaller tasks. Especially when the groups consists of 10+ people. 

In one of the sprints, we didn't split the workload. It resulted in a lot of people working on the same task, a task where only 2 people was needed and more people didn't didn't increase the workflow. Instead it almost decreased.

## Third lesson learned

Relying on the scrum process is the key to avoiding stress. Stress occurred during the exercise and will definitely occur during the project. If you try to out-perform the scrum process by doing things "on the side",
it will only result in more confusion in the group and mistakes which will cost more time than you gained.
