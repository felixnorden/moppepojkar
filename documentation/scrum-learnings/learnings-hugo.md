The first learning was about the product owner and the importance of asking the right questions. 
To ask the wrong questions leads to problems as we witnessed on the exercise when HÃ¥kan got free hands to demand anything from the developers.
We need to be smart about how we talk to the product owner to avoid having to face unrealistic expectations from the PO. 

The second learning is that we need to respect the time needed for planning and preparing. 
This problem was evident for us during the first sprint where we overestimated the amount of work we could do because we didn't count in the time needed for preparations.
This lead to us not being able to finish the tasks given to us, which of course is a failure.

The last learning is that SCRUM isn't something you just pick up and get to work with in a second, it takes time for the team to learn how to use it.
I look forward to learn how to use it during this course and in my future.
