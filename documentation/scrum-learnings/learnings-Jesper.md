# LEGO Exercise Learnings

I think one of the main things that the team will have to pay more attention
to in the future is communication. This applies both in terms of how everyone
communicates with each other and in making sure everyone lands on the same
page after discussions and shares the same vision of the final product.
During the exercise we divided and assigned the work to different groups and
gave various team members different roles but the communication between the
two teams and the people in the teams varied greatly during exercises, and as a
result the fnal product suffered. There was a number of times when two people
were working on the same model but with two very different end goals. Due to
the small scale of the project, this was perhaps not as big of an issue as it would
have been in a larger project as everyone more or less dynamically converged
on a sort of middle path, but nevertheless it did cause some frustration.
Some of these communication issues could possibly be attributed to fatigue
or boredom, but another contributing factor could perhaps been due to the roles
not being very clearly defined. The group might also have suffered due to the
lack of a Scrum Master or an equivalent role. During the exercise everyone
was working from inside the exercises and this caused the group to not have a
perhaps needed high level perspective of its own process.
