# Scrum lessons learned

From the LEGO exercise on August 31, I learned a lot of lessons when it came to working agile using Scrum. Among these lessons, the following three are the ones I feel like are the most important.

## Lesson one - Scrum board, the ultimate tool for delegation and structure

By always delegating the different user stories among the Scrum teams, based on their own estimations, the workflow and objectives became extremely clear and easy to follow. By keeping all teams present during the selection of objectives at the beginning of the sprints and by explicitly marking each user story to a team, the risk of duplicate work and loss of communication becomes miniscule. Experiencing this first-hand today, when multiple teams built the same object, really underlined the importance of keeping the Scrum board clear, updated and organized.

## Lesson two - Asking questions, and doing it correctly

To ascertain that the Product Owner will be satisfied with the product, asking the three key questions: What?, How? and Why? is a necessity. However, even though it is the truth and nothing but the truth, it wasn't really the **whole truth**. Now, what I'm getting at here is that only asking open questions, i.e questions without any restrictions, often leads to more clarity, but also a lot more work. And by a lot, I really mean **a lot**.

If an answer given by the Product Owner is too broad, then giving follow-up questions to restrict the set of possible outcomes is necessary. By keeping on asking follow-ups until the Product Owner and the team stand on even ground, the risk of misinterpretation gets smaller and smaller as a clearer product definition gets produced. Also, asking more complex questions to the Product Owner encourages having a **dialogue** instead of a **monologue** as the Product Owner will be forced to reflect on his/hers decisions.

## Lesson three - Retrospective, retrospective and retrospective

Staying focused and always actively reflecting on what went well, what went less so and on what could be improved after each sprint really clarified what the team had to try to produce during the following iteration. Additionally, by doing so and trying to correct faulty estimations, in a field with little to no experience, really made it clear that underestimations are more motivating than overestimations.

Underestimations motivated the team and pushed it harder during the following sprint, while overestimations led to group members not having tasks to accomplish just standing still and doing nothing. However, this is a tradeoff for other important factors that need to be taken into account. For example, underestimation leads to unfinished products, which in return leads to an unsatisfied Product Owner. At the same time, the pressure to perform also increases among the teammates when things are not getting finished and no scores are given.

The key here seems to keep on practicing Scrum, accumulating experience in the problem domain and trying to balance the different factors that build up each individual's workload to maintain a healthy, fun and productive agile workflow.
