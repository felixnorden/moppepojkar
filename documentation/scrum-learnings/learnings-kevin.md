# LEGO Exercise Learnings

## First lesson learned - Organisation

A lack of planning and discussion led to the group not following the correct procedures. 
Our group started working on various lego-builds individually, and for the most part gave
little thought to quality expectations and workload. This led to our group finishing 4 builds, 
none of which were particularily good, and only one of which was actually meant to be done by
our group. Three of the builds were being worked on by other groups and since we didn't
communicate properly, we only gave ourselves more work. We quickly realised that we needed
to organise much better and would benefit a lot from properly following Scrum.

## Second lesson learned - Questions

Another VERY important lesson was realising how important it is to ask questions. We delivered 4
complete builds, but none of these were what the product owner actually wanted. This is something
that could've easily been avoided if only we simply came up to the product owner and asked "How?",
"Why?" and "What?".

## Third lesson learned - Breaking down tasks

Even if the group decided on which things we need to do and in what order, it still didn't help much
when 2 people were building a house while the rest stood around not knowing what to do. If everyone
receives a simple individual task, the work can quickly add up to more than the sum of its parts.
