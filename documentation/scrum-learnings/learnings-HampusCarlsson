# LEGO Exercise Learnings

## First lesson learned - Learning the enviroment
Before tackling a new problem like the lego excercise it's a good idea to for clues.
For example in our group we did not know where the lego was located or that everyone would be racing for it.
If we took that consideration when we set points for the different scrum items on the board, we would get a more
accurate point system. This can be used in the future aswell when working on the moped project. Do some research before
deciding about things.

## Second lesson learned - Teamwork and compromises
When the lego exercise started we were all working as individuals and not as a team. As the exersice progressed we started to work more togheter within our group.
Later the lego color crysis started and we had to raid other groups for lego peices. However also some trading was involved, like trading brown blocks for red.
This can also be used between smaller groups within the moped group.

## Third lesson learned - Working under press and reacting to feedback
We did not have a lot of time for each sprint so everyone were under a lot of stress. We failed to deliver at first and when we eventually did,
we got some good feedback from our client. This feedback was then used to create a even better version of our lego creation. We also found out
that not all the delicated time can be used for building, we still have to prepare it for delivery in the form of making sure everything sticks togheter
and moving it to the correct position. This will also be true for the real project. We will have to plan, work, and prepare for showing our work of and then
react to the feedback and learn from it.
