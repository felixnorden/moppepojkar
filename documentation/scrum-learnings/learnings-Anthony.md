# Learnings from LEGO exercise

A brief overview of some of the lessons I've, Anthony Kalcic, have learned during the LEGO exercise on the 31th of August.

## Having a clear goal to follow
By always **knowing what your goal is** your work will become more effective as you will be able to visualize what the end product or feature will be. By not knowing exactly what is needed I noticed that I spent extra time on features that I thought were needed for the Lego product but were not.

## Trying to understand why
You'll get a better picture of what you are trying to develop and do fewer assumptions, that might be wrong, if you also try to understand **why** the product owner wants to develop the product, instead of only what the product owner wants to have.

## Wording your questions right
I learned that wording questions badly can put you and your team under more stress as the answer could give you an unrealistic workload. If the product owner can get more than they'll ask for it and it's our teams job to set realistic goals for the project and explain to the product owner why these boundaries exist.
