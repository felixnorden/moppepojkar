# Half-time reflection of the project and application of SCRUM

During these past 4 weeks, we as a team have actively tried to apply SCRUM methodology and incorporate its different processes into our each stage of our workflow. Initially, we chose to split our main group into three smaller teams, each team consisting of four members. We then worked with establishing the teams' different problem domains to effectively kickstart the project. Every team had the vision of holding sprint planning and retrospectives weekly, but also daily stand-ups to keep all team members on track.

So far, the sprint reviews have been mainly handled by one of the teams, where the SM and PM have been stationed, while the rest have been working on their backlog as they saw fit.

## Sprint planning

Our sprint planning meetings were initially quite unorganized, which led to a few negative side effects... We quickly acknowledged the difficulty in creating small, vertical slices of larger user stories to efficiently produce value. However, we as a group have come to the conclusion that this was due to our nearly non-existent experience of SCRUM. Improvements of the planning workflow have been made, with a set team velocity budget and a timed planning structure in order to maintain focus. The result of our actions is that we see smaller, more tangible tasks on our sprint backlogs for every new sprint, which makes incorporation, testing and evaluation easier and more efficient.

### Fibonacci's sequence and Planning Poker

We decided upon not using Fibonacci's sequence when it came to scoring our user stories. The reason for this is that it is difficult to adapt to our set velocity of 100 pts/team. We could have chosen to adapt our velocity threshold to fit more accurately, but due to us having this insight later than sprint one we would have data problems with our KPI:s.

We have also taken notice of our scoring being a bit guessed and not really motivated. A possible solution for our problem would be the Fibonacci sequence, where we then could use planning poker as a tool to entice discussion and reflection. In return, we maybe would have had faster planning meetings, or more efficient meetings during the set time, yielding more accurate user story approximations and also thinner vertical tasks.

### INVEST

Another tool which could make our scrum plannings produce a better result would be to make more active use of the INVEST-criteria. We have talked about it a few times, but haven't really put our minds to it to sit down together and do the planning with the criteria at our side.

According to [Scrum Guides' sprint planning](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning), our meetings should take at most 2-3 hours, which we haven't touched on as of yet. It would be interesting to allocate maybe 1.5-2 hours for planning during our next sprint and then incorporate INVEST to see if the set tasks are easier to accomplish and more value is produced at the end of the sprint.

## Daily Stand-ups

Daily stand-ups have been difficult to do because we have not established a routine for it. The problem seems to be the fact that we are not gathered enough and that the groups do not prioritize them enough.
