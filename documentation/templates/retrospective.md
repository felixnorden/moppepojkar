# Retrospective

This file is a template that encapsulates the four key factors in having a successful sprint retrospective. Use these questions to allow each team member to reflect upon the work of the now ending sprint, and to find a possibly more effective workflow for the upcoming sprint.

The retrospective is split into two main parts: **Answering Questions** and **Improvements**. These parts are shortly described below.

## Questions

Below, you will find the four questions that each member needs to answer in regards of the passed sprint. Keep the tips in mind to alleviate the difficulty of giving a useful answer. One key thing to always remember is to **Keep the Team Positive**.

### What went well?

Content

**Tip:** "Think Big **and** Be Specific"

### What didnâ€™t go so well?

Content

**Tip:** "Observations on the Past Create Opportunities for the Future" and "Focus on the Facts".

### What have I learned?

Content

**Tip:** The positivity and negativity of learnings are irrelevant, the important thing is that you've learned something.

### What still puzzles me?

Content

**Tip:** Keep the questions open and feel free to express concerns, misgivings and doubts about the topic. This will engage the other team members to help you.

## Improvements

When everyone has answered their questions, the group should have some insights on what happened over the sprint that we've reflected upon. After that, we need to identify the actions we want to take to ascertain some form of improvements.

With the small time frames in mind, devoting time for improvements can be difficult. Therefore, it is usually better to take on a small amount of improvements at a time.

**Tip:** Have the group review the everybody's answers and find the top 3 items to address in terms of importance and value.

**Tip:** If there are some problems to be tackled, spend some time to find the root cause of the problem. This way, avoidance of a snowball effect is improved and an **improvement** may be found immediately.
