# Sprint review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

This is a one- to two-hour time-boxed meeting for each Sprint. **The Scrum Master** ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. **The Scrum Master** teaches all to keep it within the time-box.

The Sprint Review includes the following elements:

- Attendees include the **Scrum Team** and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner.
- The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”.
- The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved.
- The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment.
- The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date (if needed).
- The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning.
- Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next.
- Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product.

The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.

## Information to bring for meeting

This section should be filled out with information necessary to affirm the certainty that the Dev team can:

- answer questions regarding the "Done" features
- make remarks on what went well
- describe impediments that may have occurred
- reminding information as for demonstrating the "Done" features

### Checklist of Product Backlog items

This section should have a list of the chosen Product Backlog items, which is marked off wether it is "Done" or not.

-

### Keywords of results from sprint

This section should contain keywords that can be used to induce discussion among the attendees regarding:

- What went well
- Impediments that occurred
- Solutions for the impediments

**Note:** These keywords are only to be used if the attendees **do not** bring up and start discussing valuable information regarding the sprint results.

### Keywords/planning of demonstration

This section should contain keywords/information to perform a successful demonstration of the produced value (Product Backlog that is "Done").

## Information to take back from meeting

This section is meant to be filled with the useful information that has occurred during the meeting. This information will then be used in the upcoming Sprint planning and to update the Product Backlog according to the PO's wishes.

The necessary points are:

- redefining/adding features from PO
- feature prioritization
- review of potential use of the product, which may have changed and also shifted the features' priorities around
- review of:
    - timeline
    - budget
    - potential capabilities
    - marketplace *(if potential use has changed)*

### Product Backlog changes

This section should be filled with the possible changes that is to be made of the Product Backlog, according to the feedback given from the PO and possibly other attending stakeholders.

### Other valuable information

This section should contain information that doesn't directly affect the Product Backlog, but that is still valuable for the team. Necessary information would be feedback that is useful for:

- documentation, such as:
    - reasons for product change, preferably with rationale
    - topics for re-designing the software architecture/features
- the following Sprint Retrospective, such as:
    - good points
    - constructive criticism
    - prioritization
    - knowledge that increase the rationale of the PO
- the upcoming Sprint Planning, such as:
    - possible Product Backlog slices
    - possible Product Backlog concurrency/parallell implementation

**Note:** The list above holds examples of what **may** be valuable information.
