The following KPIs are the primary indicators that will be used during the project's iterations to facilitate scrum retrospectives and reviews. 

## Individual velocity

Velocity charts on individual team members, which have been evaluated using the following non-dependent factors:

1. Stress
1. Difficulty compared to estimation
1. Performance
1. Produced quality

## Produced velocity

Estimations regarding production value will be made for each iteration. The threshold will be kept static, while individual feature estimations will be adapted. If a feature isn't finished, then the score will be 0 in that sprint.

The user stories' score will be estimated in the whole group and delegated into the individual teams.

The delegated user story will then be split up into different use cases with a specific score by the associated teams.

*Each user story will then be split into different tasks (will be filled out later, possibly)*

## Product Owner satisfaction

At the weekly sprint review, the Product Owner will be asked to grade his/her value of the current product.
This will then be set into perspective with the agreed Produced velocity. If there are big differences, then actions regarding adaptation and negotiation with the Product Owner will be taken. This way, the communication between the team and the Product Owner will improve and follow up questions can be asked for eliciting clearer requirements.

## Code coverage

Charts based upon test coverage on produced code.
